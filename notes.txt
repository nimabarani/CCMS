psql -U $(whoami) -d postgres -f db/create_roles.sql

psql -U client_admin -d postgres -f db/create_db_and_table.sql

## ERRORS
- client_admin didn't have the create table permission first, but were given in create_roles.sql

- psql:db/import_and_encrypt.sql:7: ERROR:  must be superuser or have privileges of the pg_read_server_files role to COPY from a file
HINT:  Anyone can COPY to stdout or from stdin. psql's \copy command also works for anyone.

### NOTES ###

Password management via psql comes with three security vulnerabilities:

The password is visible on the screen.
Viewing the command history exposes the password.
The information is transmitted as clear text without any encryption.
